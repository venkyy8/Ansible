## What Are Ansible Roles?
Ansible roles are a way to **organize playbooks** into reusable components.  
They allow you to group tasks, variables, handlers, templates, and files into a structured format.  
This makes automation **more modular, shareable, and easier to maintain**.

## Use Case of Roles
- Installing and configuring software (e.g., Apache, Nginx, MySQL).  
- Managing users and groups.  
- Setting up environments (e.g., dev, test, prod).  
- Reusing automation across multiple projects.  
- Sharing roles via **Ansible Galaxy**.

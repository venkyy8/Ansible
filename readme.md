# Ansible Automation Playground ðŸŽ­

Welcome to my **Ansible GitHub repo** â€“ where YAML meets caffeine and servers finally obey.  

This repo contains a collection of **playbooks, roles, vaults, and automation tasks** designed to automate repetitive stuff so humans can take coffee breaks without breaking anything.

## ðŸš€ What This Repo Does
- Automates database backups and restores (because who wants to do that manually?).  
- Manages configurations and roles like a pro (or at least tries to).  
- Secures secrets in vaults so your API keys donâ€™t wander off.  
- Runs scheduled tasks with cron so automation actually works while you sleep.
